## The idea behind Echora

**The GUI in this repository was created entirely by GPT-6-Astra.** Echora is the product name; GPT-6-Astra is the model that built it. The name draws on *echo*: bringing the ChatGPT app’s interaction experience into a native Rust and GPUI application.

The ambition is to **recreate the complete ChatGPT desktop app interaction experience through Codex app-server**. That means the details of the workflow as well as the appearance: starting and restoring conversations, streaming replies, steering active turns, approving actions, editing files, using terminals, reviewing changes, and navigating settings.

As more coding agents are integrated, users should be able to keep that same workflow while working with products from different providers. The interface stays familiar as the choice of agents grows.

| Part of the project | Role |
|---|---|
| **GPT-6-Astra** | Created the GUI implementation in this repository. |
| **Rust + GPUI** | Render the native application and handle its interactions. |
| **Codex app-server** | Connects the GUI to Codex’s backend capabilities. |
| **ChatGPT app** | The reference for the complete interaction experience being recreated. |
| **Other coding agents** | Future integrations through provider-specific adapters. |

**Implementation status:** full interaction parity is the goal. Today, only part of Codex app-server is connected; some navigation and settings entries remain placeholders, and other coding agents are not integrated yet. [The integration table](docs/APP_SERVER_INTEGRATION.md) records the actual coverage. Echora is an independent application, not an official OpenAI product or an extension running inside ChatGPT.

</details>

Both images are captured from the current native application using the dedicated `GPUI Capture.app` build and a deterministic example of conversation and tool activity, without running the displayed commands or sending model requests. The interface currently retains some Codex labels. These are application screenshots, not design mockups.

## What you can do today

| Workflow | Available behavior |
|---|---|
| **Projects & conversations** | Create, restore, search, rename, archive, delete, move, and pin conversations. Switching conversations keeps background turns running. |
| **Talk while the agent works** | Stream responses and send additional input into an active turn. Plans, search, waits, tool activity, and file changes appear in the timeline. |
| **Approve actions** | Inspect command, file, and extra-permission requests in native cards. View automatic review outcomes and choose supported permission profiles. |
| **Answer MCP requests** | Answer `mcpServer/elicitation/request` in native form and url cards: validate required, typed, ranged, and enumerated fields, send structured content only on accept, map skip and cancel to their own protocol actions, and settle only after `serverRequest/resolved`. |
| **Start a chat** | Empty chats show the project heading and composer without placeholder suggestions. |
| **Work with files** | Browse the local file tree, filter paths, edit in tabs, preview Markdown and images, and follow file links to a line. |
| **Use the terminal** | Run the local shell in the conversation directory, with tabs, scrollback, text selection, and clipboard support. |
| **Review & ship changes** | Inspect Git diffs, comment on lines, stage, restore, commit, create branches, push, and open pull requests through the local `gh` CLI. |
| **Browse pull requests** | Open the sidebar's `Pull requests` page: list and filter pull requests, read the summary, activity, commits and checks, browse the diff with its file tree, review lines inline, and open a review tab from the change stats. |
| **Explore in side chats** | Fork temporary conversations from the main thread, with their own input, model, permissions, and stop controls. |
| **Configure Codex** | Read effective configuration and its sources, inspect managed restrictions, edit supported user settings, and verify saves against the backend. |
| **Manage the account** | See the connected ChatGPT account and plan in the account menu; sign in through Codex-managed ChatGPT auth, cancel a pending login, and sign out behind a confirmation. |
| **Manage skills & MCP** | Read the skills inventory with per-skill enable/disable receipts, list MCP servers with status, auth, tools and server extensions, reload servers, and complete OAuth logins with explicit waiting, success, failure, cancellation and disconnect states. |
| **Manage plugins & apps** | Read the plugin catalog and the installed subset from the backend, search marketplaces, open a plugin's own detail (description, skills, MCP servers), install and uninstall behind a confirmation, manage marketplaces (add, update, remove), read shared plugins, and read a plugin skill's contents. Directory rows, badges and counts are always the served values; a plugin the server ships without artwork or description renders that way instead of a placeholder row. |

The exact protocol coverage and compatibility rules live in [the app-server integration table](docs/APP_SERVER_INTEGRATION.md). A visible control does not imply full support for the corresponding provider feature.

## Get started

The current development and verification platform is **macOS**. Install the Rust toolchain pinned in [rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml), the macOS build tools, and a logged-in Codex CLI available on `PATH`. The current integration baseline is `codex-cli 0.154.0`; see the integration table before changing CLI versions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rita152/Echora.git
cd Echora

rustc --version
codex --version
cargo run --release -- --theme=dark
```

Use `--theme=light` for the light theme. `cargo run -- --theme=dark` uses the optimized development profile for local iteration. Launch from the repository root for the examples below.

Echora starts `codex app-server --stdio` and uses the local Codex installation for backend configuration and sessions. Git review requires Git; creating pull requests also requires an authenticated `gh`. Python, Node.js, and Electron are development verification tools, not requirements for running the native interface.

The Cargo package and executable are still named `gpui-chat-clone`, so the existing build and capture commands continue to use that name. Prebuilt releases and cross-platform verification are not provided yet.

## Find your way around

| Action | Entry point / shortcut |
|---|---|
| Open a conversation | Sidebar projects, recent items, archive, or search |
| Search chats | Sidebar search button → the chat search dialog (`Enter` opens, `⌘1`–`⌘9` select, `Esc` closes) |
| Toggle the terminal | Right panel → Terminal; `Ctrl+Backtick` |
| Open files | Right panel → Files; `Cmd+P` |
| Open Git review | Right panel → Review; `Ctrl+Shift+G` |
| Open a side chat | Right/bottom panel menu; `Option+Cmd+S` |
| Open settings | Account menu → Settings; `Cmd+,` |
| Sign in / sign out | Account menu → the sign-in row, or `Log out` with the in-app confirmation |
| Send / add input to an active turn | `Enter`; `Shift+Enter` inserts a newline |
| Save a file immediately | `Cmd+S` |
| Clear the terminal | `Cmd+K` |
| Switch / close panel tabs | `Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`; `Cmd+W` |

<details>
<summary>Behavior and current boundaries</summary>

- **Active-turn input:** additional input uses `turn/steer`. It is sent immediately to the active turn; there is no server-side message queue. Failed submissions can be restored with their attachments and review comments, without overwriting newer drafts or automatically starting another turn.
- **Live output and history:** live and restored completed turns use the same final-answer selection, work disclosure, response actions, and file summary. Text deltas retain their item identity; completed message snapshots reconcile the displayed text. Adjacent deltas are batched over 8 ms, and code highlighting reuses completed lines while reparsing the unfinished line. Completed turns collapse intermediate messages before the final answer. Added user messages retain their position and attachments. File changes are grouped by path while retaining the original patch. History comes from app-server; missing timing, plan snapshots, and automatic-review history are not invented.
- **Approvals:** concurrent requests appear in order, and a submitted card waits for server resolution. A failed response is visible and cannot be submitted twice. Inspect the original requested patch or expand and copy long commands. Keyboard navigation uses Tab/arrows, Enter, and Esc; `Shift+Esc` rejects a file request and stops the turn.
- **Permissions:** profiles are read across all backend pages and show unavailable choices with reasons. The menu hides the built-in `:read-only` profile and omits the subsequent-turn hint and manual reload action. Existing-thread changes become effective only after RPC success and a matching settings notification, and affect subsequent turns. Full access requires an in-app confirmation; side chats maintain independent settings. If another app-server holds the thread, a warning card stays above the composer while the conversation scrolls.
- **Account:** the account menu and the sign-in flow are driven by the connection's account snapshot. A missing plan is reported as unknown rather than guessed, a pending login keeps its server-issued id until the completion notification arrives, and signing out is confirmed before the request is sent. Only the Codex-managed ChatGPT login is exposed; API-key, external-token, and Bedrock variants report an explicit error. See the integration table for the exact protocol coverage.
- **Configuration:** supported edits use versioned `config/batchWrite` followed by readback. Project and managed layers are read-only. Conflicts retain the draft; unknown outcomes are not retried automatically. Saved model, reasoning, service-tier, and personality defaults apply to future threads, without hot-updating open ones.
- **Activity:** plans support streaming, progress, copying, explicit download, and read-only file tabs. Search preserves queries and results; waits retain duration and status. Hook feedback is read-only. Automatic-review details support keyboard navigation and text selection, and follow reduced-motion preferences. Authentication recovery and deprecation-display boundaries are documented in the integration table.
- **File editing:** autosave runs about 400 ms after typing stops; undo and redo also write to disk. UTF-8 BOM, CRLF, and permissions are retained, and external edits are checked before saving. Text files are limited to 2 MiB and individual lines to 64 KiB; files are local only.
- **Git review:** scopes include the last turn, uncommitted, unstaged, staged, committed, and branch changes; branch review uses merge-base. Unified/split views, word diffs, context expansion, and line comments are available. Writes validate the worktree and index first. Restoring a newly added file preserves a backup under the worktree Git directory's `gpui-discarded/`.
- **Panel lifetime:** collapsing panels or switching conversations preserves their state. Shell sessions and temporary side chats do not survive app exit. Tabs can be reordered by dragging; closing a side chat with messages requires confirmation. Disconnected side chats remain readable and copyable.
- **Chat search:** the dialog lists pinned chats first and then recency order, capped at nine rows, and searches through app-server `thread/search` once a query is typed. The reference app also merges ChatGPT cloud conversations from its own search service, which app-server does not expose, so matching and ordering can differ once a query has many hits. `Search files` (or `P`) switches the same dialog to file search: it opens a `fuzzyFileSearch` session for the conversation working directory, streams `sessionUpdated` results as you type, highlights the server match indices, and opens the chosen file in the file panel. Servers without session support fall back to the one-shot `fuzzyFileSearch` request.
- **Rewrite a message:** the newest user message offers an edit action in its hover actions. Submitting the rewritten text calls `thread/revert` with that turn as `beforeTurnId`, which replaces the durable history with the prefix before it, and then starts a fresh `turn/start`. Only conversation history moves; local files are untouched, and the turns reload through the normal paging path.
- **Compact context:** typing `/compact` in the composer runs `thread/compact/start`. Compaction runs as a non-steerable turn, so additional input during it reports the server answer, and the existing context-compaction item shows the outcome.

`ChatApp` assembles shared services and injects `AgentBackend` into the views. The backend owns project and conversation data. Echora persists UI preferences locally and does not maintain its own conversation database. Future adapters will implement the shared contract according to their actual protocols and product needs.

| Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [src/agent/](src/agent/) | Backend contracts and domain types for models, messages, events, approvals, activity, configuration, and history; no GPUI dependency in domain modules. |
| [src/agent/codex/](src/agent/codex/) | Codex codecs, method validation, transport, requests, and dispatch. Connection lifecycle and routing live in `manager.rs` and `manager/`. |
| [src/workspace.rs](src/workspace.rs), [src/workspace/](src/workspace/) | Workspace state and notification merging; pagination in `loaders.rs`, atomic UI preference storage in `preferences.rs`. |
| [src/conversation/](src/conversation/) | Conversation state, event reduction, stream batching, and history restoration; no GPUI Entity or Context. |
| [src/configuration.rs](src/configuration.rs) | Configuration drafts, save receipts, and readback verification, using types from `src/agent/config.rs`. |
| [src/components/](src/components/) | Composer, timeline, approvals, files, terminal, review, and side-chat rendering and interaction. |
| [src/git_review.rs](src/git_review.rs), [src/git_review/](src/git_review/) | Git/gh operations, diffs, version validation, process cleanup, and comments, independent of GPUI and agent adapters. |
| [src/app.rs](src/app.rs), [src/app/](src/app/) | Service assembly, conversation hosts, panel mounting, project creation, and image preview. |
| [src/settings/](src/settings/), [src/media.rs](src/media.rs), [src/typography.rs](src/typography.rs) | Settings pages, shared media helpers, fonts, and typography capture. |

On macOS, UI preferences default to `~/Library/Application Support/GPUI/ui-preferences.json`. Set `GPUI_UI_PREFERENCES_PATH` to use an isolated file during verification. Backend configuration is not stored in UI preferences.

GPUI dependencies share the pinned Zed revision in [Cargo.toml](Cargo.toml). Local patches in `vendor/gpui`, `vendor/gpui_macos`, and `vendor/gpui_apple` cover text, selection, virtual lists, and Metal compositing; review these when upgrading. OpenAI Sans is loaded from an existing local ChatGPT installation when available, with a system-font fallback. The font is not distributed in this repository.

## Development & verification

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --no-deps -p gpui-chat-clone -- -D warnings
cargo check --all-targets
cargo check --all-targets --features screenshot
cargo build --features screenshot
git diff --check
```

The warning-free Clippy requirement applies to the first-party package. Tests that make real model requests and manual scrolling benchmarks are ignored by default.

For configuration and permissions integration checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_config_permissions.py --output artifacts/config-permissions-smoke
```

This uses the local CLI with an isolated configuration home and Git project under the output directory. It verifies real reads, writes, overrides, version conflicts, invalid values, null deletion, profile pagination, thread-setting receipts, and process restart. It sends no model requests and does not change the user's existing configuration.

The integration table itself is checked against the CLI schema: method sets, the default/experimental column, status counts, and the opt-out list in `src/agent/codex/runtime.rs` are re-derived, and a temporary schema export is generated when `artifacts/` is empty.

```bash
node scripts/verify_integration_table.mjs
```

### Capture the native app

Follow the dedicated-instance rules in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Build the latest executable, package it with the separate capture bundle ID, and launch that instance:

```bash
cargo build --features screenshot
mkdir -p 'target/GPUI Capture.app/Contents/MacOS' artifacts
cp scripts/gpui_capture_info.plist 'target/GPUI Capture.app/Contents/Info.plist'
cp target/debug/gpui-chat-clone 'target/GPUI Capture.app/Contents/MacOS/gpui-chat-clone'
codesign --force --sign - 'target/GPUI Capture.app'

GPUI_UI_PREFERENCES_PATH="$PWD/artifacts/capture-preferences.json" \
GPUI_CAPTURE_OUTPUT="$PWD/artifacts/frame.png" \
  'target/GPUI Capture.app/Contents/MacOS/gpui-chat-clone' \
  --theme=light --window-width=1440 --window-height=900
```

Enumerate apps in Computer Use, connect to **GPUI Capture**, inspect the accessibility tree and screenshot, and then navigate. Press `Cmd+Shift+F12` to save an unscaled PNG with a `.render.json` sidecar while the app keeps running. Close only the dedicated instance you started.

For a real live-turn capture, launch with `--capture-live-turn="$PWD/artifacts/live.png"` and submit a prompt in the capture app. It saves the completed live view before history reload, a `.json` sidecar with thread identity, activity data, then exits. It fails on interruption, turn failure or a five-minute timeout.

For automatic capture of a saved thread, append `--resume-thread=THREAD_ID --screenshot="$PWD/artifacts/resumed-thread.png"`. IDs accept a UUID or `local:<uuid>`. Optional `--resume-scroll-from-bottom=3200` sets the scroll distance; omission captures the bottom. The app waits for history, sidebar, model catalog, and three stable frames, then exits; failures and timeouts return a nonzero status. Use a thread that is not held by another active writer.

Window sizes are logical pixels; PNG resolution depends on the display's DPR. Compare the same theme, content, dimensions, DPR, and scroll position, without scaling or translating images. The older `scripts/compare_all.sh` rescales captures and is not a pixel-acceptance entry point. Keep raw captures, logs, and comparison output in `artifacts/`; curated README images live in `docs/images/`.

<details>
<summary>Additional capture and verification entry points</summary>

Full launch options are in [src/main.rs](src/main.rs).

| Option | Use |
|---|---|
| `--markdown-file=/absolute/path/to/sample.txt` | Standalone Markdown window without app-server; combine with `--window-width=480` for narrow layouts. |
| `--file-panel-root=/absolute/workspace --open-file=/absolute/file` | Real file editing, saving, and conflict checks; use disposable files. |
| `--review-root=/absolute/repository --review-filter=src/example.rs` | Real Git review; screenshots wait for the diff to load. |
| `--settings-page=appearance` | Open a settings page; slugs are in `src/settings/mod.rs`. |
| `--chat-search-state=initial\|selected\|hover\|query\|no-match` | Open the chat search dialog in a fixed state for capture; combine with `--chat-search-query=` and `--chat-search-index=`. |
| `--image-generation-ui-state=running/completed/failed/load-error` | Fixed image-generation states; completed also uses `--image-generation-path=/absolute/image.png`. |
| `--auto-approval-ui-state=inProgress/approved/denied/timedOut/aborted/strict/warning` | Automatic review; add `--auto-approval-expanded`, `--auto-approval-details-expanded`, or `--reduce-motion`. Long text and motion traces use `--auto-approval-rationale-file` and `--auto-approval-motion-output`. |
| `--runtime-ui-state=completed/running/turnless/auth-started/auth-completed/interrupted/disconnected/history/long/deprecation` | Deterministic Hook, hookPrompt, authentication, and app-notice states, without hooks or model requests. Set `GPUI_RUNTIME_AUDIT_OUTPUT` for raw state and local completion reasons. |
| `--progress-ui-state=running/streaming/completed/interrupted` | Plan, search, and wait reduction; streaming emits timed updates and completion, and running can be interrupted. |
| `--typography-specimen --typography-display=N` | Font samples and display selection; see `src/typography.rs`. |
| `--pull-requests [--pull-requests-select=N \| --pull-requests-title=TEXT] [--pull-requests-tab=code\|review] [--pull-requests-list-tab=all\|reviewing\|authored] [--pull-requests-status=open\|merged\|closed\|all] [--pull-requests-search=TEXT] [--pull-requests-file-tree] [--pull-requests-scroll=px] [--pull-requests-action=...] [--pull-requests-comment-menu]` | Deterministic Pull Requests states: list, tabs, search, filters, groups, detail sections, diff, file tree, review tab, and the interaction states `scripts/capture_pull_requests_gpui.sh` uses. |

`--approval-replay=/absolute/fixture.json` replays offline JSON-RPC through production parsing and response handling. The fixture contains an `events` array from `turn/started` through items and approval requests, with optional `cwd`, `userMessage`, `assistantMessage`, and `failWrites`. Responses are written to an adjacent `.responses.jsonl`; replay does not execute commands or modify approved files.

The Pull Requests page is captured with `scripts/capture_pull_requests_reference.sh` (reference, per-theme app appearance) and `scripts/capture_pull_requests_gpui.sh both full` (native), then scored per component with `scripts/compare_pull_requests_suite.py`; `scripts/verify_pull_requests_ux_reference.mjs` drives the reference through the acceptance sequence. Keep every raw capture, log, and score in `artifacts/`.

Visual scripts require Python 3 with Pillow, NumPy, and websocket-client. CDP scripts need Node.js with global WebSocket support. Settings checks additionally need Electron (`npm ci`) and `jq`. Capture ChatGPT references only from a dedicated debug instance using a newly allocated port:

```bash
export CHATGPT_CDP_HTTP="http://127.0.0.1:${CAPTURE_CDP_PORT:?Set a dedicated debug port}"
```

| Check | Entry point |
|---|---|
| Saved threads, both themes | `python3 scripts/capture_resume_reference.py --endpoint "$CHATGPT_CDP_HTTP" --manifest /path/to/manifest.json`; `python3 scripts/capture_resume_gpui.py --manifest /path/to/manifest.json --output artifacts/resume-alignment/actual` |
| Terminal / files | `node scripts/cdp_capture_terminal.mjs artifacts/terminal`; `node scripts/cdp_capture_file_panel.mjs artifacts/file-panel` |
| Review / side chat | `node scripts/cdp_capture_review.mjs artifacts/review-reference`; `node scripts/cdp_capture_side_chat.mjs artifacts/side-chat reference` |
| Account menu, logout | `node scripts/cdp_capture_account.mjs --output artifacts/account-phase/chatgpt-reference --theme=light`; `scripts/capture_account_gpui.sh`; `python3 scripts/compare_account_phase.py` |
| Settings matrix | `./node_modules/.bin/electron scripts/verify_chatgpt_settings.cjs`; `REFRESH_SETTINGS_REFERENCES=1 scripts/capture_settings_matrix.sh`; `python3 scripts/verify_settings_matrix.py` |
| Merged Phase 1–4 local-component gate | `python3 scripts/stage4/compare_merge_gate.py` (expects the dedicated ChatGPT/GPUI captures under `artifacts/merge-four-worktrees/`; threshold is 99% per local component) |
| Image generation | `python3 scripts/compare_image_generation_component.py --help`; supply measured equal-size crops and DPR. |
| History diagnostics | `python3 scripts/audit_resume_rendering.py --help`; rollout files are for offline diagnostics only. |

Thread manifests are JSON arrays with `id`, `title`, and `slug`. Thread/settings comparisons use 1440×900 at DPR 1 on a 1× display; the settings matrix covers 18 pages in both themes. The merged Phase 1–4 gate compares fixed local component regions after one documented 2×→1× BOX normalization and records crops, diffs, and scores in `artifacts/merge-four-worktrees/visual/final-report/`. Git-write verification uses temporary repositories and a local bare remote; PR command-chain checks use a `gh` test double.

```bash
GPUI_MARKDOWN_BENCH_FILE=docs/APP_SERVER_INTEGRATION.md \
  cargo test markdown_preview_scroll_timings -- --ignored --nocapture
GPUI_DIFF_BENCH_PATCH=/absolute/path/to/long.diff \

```

`cargo test live_conversation_stream_timings -- --ignored --nocapture` measures 500 live conversation updates plus GPUI layout and verifies that scrolling up stays anchored during subsequent output.

`cargo test streaming_highlight_timings -- --ignored --nocapture` compares incremental syntax highlighting with a full parse for 500 growing Rust-code updates and checks exact span equality.

Scrolling benchmarks measure event/layout time in a GPUI test window, not screen FPS. Typography comparison counts glyph pixels only. For 2×, set the CDP scale to `2`, use a real Retina display for GPUI, and compare with `--dpr=2`. Save translucent captures separately: add `--translucent` to CDP/comparison scripts and `--typography-translucent` to GPUI. The comparison composites both alpha encodings onto the same background.

## Where Echora is heading

- Recreate the complete ChatGPT app interaction experience in native GPUI, including its detailed interaction behavior.
- Support more coding agent providers through their real protocols and capabilities.
- Unify local agent discovery, configuration, launch, sessions, and runtime status.
- Keep familiar conversation and review workflows as the choice of agents grows.
- Expand Codex coverage where it serves the product, with explicit compatibility boundaries.

These are directions, not shipped integrations or release-date commitments. For contributions, begin with [the repository conventions](AGENTS.md) and [the app-server integration table](docs/APP_SERVER_INTEGRATION.md). Keep the English and Chinese READMEs aligned when behavior changes.
